# Notebooks on Image Processing, Machine Learning, and More.

## Overview:
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks focused on image processing and machine learning tasks. <br>
As new notebooks are added, each entry below will describe what the notebook is about.

## **Notebooks**:
- `Notebook 001`: This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to performing image processing tasks using the Python PIL library, including resizing, cropping, rotating, flipping, and saving images.
- `Notebook 002`: This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of image processing techniques using the Python skimage library, covering operations such as filtering, edge detection, resizing, and entropy analysis, with a focus on processing grayscale images and analyzing wound healing in scratch assays.
- `Notebook 003`: This notebook demonstrates the analysis of wound healing in scratch assay images using entropy-based segmentation and Otsuâ€™s thresholding, followed by linear regression to assess the rate of wound closure over time.
