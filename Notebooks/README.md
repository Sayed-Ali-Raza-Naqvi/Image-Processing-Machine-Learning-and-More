# Notebooks on Image Processing, Machine Learning, and More.

## Overview:
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks focused on image processing and machine learning tasks. <br>
As new notebooks are added, each entry below will describe what the notebook is about.

## **Notebooks**:
- `Notebook 001`: This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to performing image processing tasks using the Python PIL library, including resizing, cropping, rotating, flipping, and saving images.
- `Notebook 002`: This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of image processing techniques using the Python skimage library, covering operations such as filtering, edge detection, resizing, and entropy analysis, with a focus on processing grayscale images and analyzing wound healing in scratch assays.
- `Notebook 003`: This notebook demonstrates the analysis of wound healing in scratch assay images using entropy-based segmentation and Otsu’s thresholding, followed by linear regression to assess the rate of wound closure over time.
- `Notebook 004`: This notebook covers denoising techniques using Python, specifically Gaussian filter, Median filter, and Non-local Means (NLM) denoising. It aims to reduce noise in images while preserving important details, demonstrating how different filters handle noise and the trade-offs between them.
- `Notebook 005`: This notebook demonstrates histogram-based image segmentation by denoising a noisy image using Non-local Means (NLM) and then segmenting it into different regions based on intensity thresholds. The segmented regions are refined using morphological operations to remove noise and enhance the clarity of each region.
- `Notebook 006`: This notebook demonstrates image segmentation using the Random Walker algorithm. The workflow includes preprocessing the image with denoising and adaptive histogram equalization, defining markers for segmentation, and applying the Random Walker algorithm to divide the image into distinct regions. The segmented regions are visualized in color, helping to interpret the segmentation results effectively.
- `Notebook 007`: This notebook provides an overview of basic image processing techniques using OpenCV. The workflow includes loading an image, exploring pixel values at key positions, splitting color channels, and resizing the image. The color channels are displayed individually and then merged back, followed by resizing the image with interpolation to achieve a reduced size.
- `Notebook 008`: This notebook demonstrates image denoising and edge detection techniques using OpenCV. It applies several blurring filters, including custom, average, Gaussian, median, and bilateral filters, to denoise an image. For edge detection, the Canny Edge Detection algorithm is used on a grayscale image to highlight edges effectively, with the results displayed using Matplotlib.
- `Notebook 009`: This notebook explores histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and various thresholding methods using OpenCV for image enhancement. Histogram equalization is first applied to enhance contrast, followed by CLAHE to adaptively adjust local contrast. Three thresholding techniques (binary, binary inverse, and Otsu's thresholding) are then used on the CLAHE-enhanced image to separate the foreground and background. The Otsu's threshold value is calculated and printed for reference.
- `Notebook 010`: This notebook demonstrates thresholding and morphological operations using OpenCV. After reading and displaying an image, Otsu’s thresholding is applied to create a binary mask. Morphological operations—including erosion, dilation, opening, closing, top hat, and black hat—are performed using a 3x3 kernel to refine the segmentation and highlight specific features. Median blurring is applied to reduce noise, followed by a second Otsu thresholding on the denoised image, with the new threshold value printed for reference.
- `Notebook 011`: This notebook explores key point detection and feature description methods using OpenCV. It begins by converting an image to grayscale and performing Harris corner detection, marking detected corners in red. The Shi-Tomasi method is then used to identify prominent points, visualized with circles on the grayscale image. A FAST detector is implemented to detect key points, followed by ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) to detect and compute key points and descriptors, with results visualized on the original image.
